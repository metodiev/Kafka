## Kafka Streams Basics

### 1. What is Kafka Streams?
Kafka Streams is a **client library** for building real-time, fault-tolerant, and scalable stream processing applications on top of Kafka.


### 2. Key Features
- Processes data in **real-time** from Kafka topics.
- Supports **stateful** and **stateless** operations.
- Integrated with Kafkaâ€™s consumer and producer APIs.
- Built-in fault tolerance and state management.
- Easy to deploy as standalone Java applications.

### 3. Core Concepts
| Concept       | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Stream        | Continuous flow of records from topics     |
| Processor     | Unit that processes or transforms streams  |
| Topology      | Graph of processors and streams             |
| State Store  | Persistent storage for stateful operations   |


### 4. Simple Kafka Streams Example
```java
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("input-topic");
KStream<String, String> uppercased = source.mapValues(value -> value.toUpperCase());
uppercased.to("output-topic");

KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), props);
streams.start();
```

### 5. Use Cases
Real-time ETL pipelines.
Aggregations, filtering, and joining streams.
Fraud detection and anomaly detection.
Event-driven microservices.
