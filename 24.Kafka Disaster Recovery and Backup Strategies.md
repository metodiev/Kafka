## Kafka Disaster Recovery and Backup Strategies

### 1. Why Disaster Recovery (DR) Matters
Kafka clusters are critical infrastructure; failures or data loss can impact business continuity.  
DR strategies minimize downtime and data loss.


### 2. Common Disaster Recovery Approaches

| Approach                | Description                                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-Region Clusters   | Deploy Kafka clusters across multiple data centers for failover. |
| MirrorMaker             | Kafka tool to replicate topics between clusters (active-active or active-passive). |
| Backup and Restore      | Periodic backups of Kafka logs and metadata for restore. |


### 3. Using Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0
- Replicates data between Kafka clusters.
- Supports active-active and disaster recovery setups.
- Can filter topics and transform data during replication.


### 4. Backup Best Practices
- Store backups in durable, offsite storage (e.g., cloud storage, NAS).
- Automate backup processes and verify regularly.
- Backup Kafka metadata (Zookeeper or KRaft data).


### 5. Recovery Considerations
- Plan for consistent data states across replicated clusters.
- Test failover and failback procedures.
- Monitor replication lag and health.


### 6. Summary
Disaster recovery in Kafka relies on replication, backups, and multi-region deployments to ensure resilience and data durability.
