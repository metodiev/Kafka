## Kafka Transactions and Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)

### 1. What are Kafka Transactions?
Kafka transactions allow producers to send messages to multiple partitions and topics atomically.  
All messages in a transaction are either committed or aborted as a single unit.


### 2. Why Transactions Matter?
- Ensure **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)** in distributed streaming.
- Avoid duplicates or partial writes caused by retries or failures.
- Important for financial systems, inventory updates, or any critical data flows.


### 3. How Transactions Work
- Producer begins a transaction.
- Sends messages to one or more partitions/topics.
- Commits or aborts the transaction.
- Consumers configured with `isolation.level=read_committed` read only committed data.


### 4. Producer Configuration for Transactions
```properties
enable.idempotence=true
transactional.id=your-unique-transactional-id
```

### 5. Using Transactions in Code (Java Example)
```java
producer.initTransactions();
try {
    producer.beginTransaction();
    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("topic1", key, value));
    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("topic2", key, value));
    producer.commitTransaction();
} catch (Exception e) {
    producer.abortTransaction();
}

```

### 6. Consumer Isolation Levels
read_uncommitted (default): reads all data, including uncommitted.
read_committed: reads only committed transactional messages, preventing dirty reads.
