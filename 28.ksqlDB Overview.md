## ksqlDB Overview

### 1. What is ksqlDB?
ksqlDB is a streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka that lets you process and query real-time data using SQL-like syntax without writing traditional code.


### 2. Key Features
- **SQL for Streams:** Define continuous queries over Kafka topics.
- **Materialized Views:** Store results of queries for fast lookups.
- **Event Streaming Applications:** Build apps entirely with SQL.
- **Integration with Kafka Streams:** Under the hood, runs on Kafka Streams API.


### 3. Core Concepts
- **Stream:** A continuous, append-only flow of events.
- **Table:** A view of the latest value for each key (similar to relational DB tables).
- **Persistent Queries:** Always-on transformations of incoming data.
- **Push/Pull Queries:** Fetch data on demand or receive continuous updates.


### 4. Example: Filtering Events with ksqlDB
```sql
CREATE STREAM purchases (
    user_id VARCHAR,
    item_id VARCHAR,
    price DOUBLE
) WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC='purchases',
    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'
);

CREATE STREAM high_value_purchases AS
SELECT * FROM purchases
WHERE price > 1000;
```

### 5. Use Cases
Real-time monitoring dashboards.
Fraud detection with continuous filtering.
Data enrichment and transformation without custom code.
Powering APIs with live data.
