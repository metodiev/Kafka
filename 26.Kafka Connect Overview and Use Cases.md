## Kafka Connect Overview and Use Cases

### 1. What is Kafka Connect?
Kafka Connect is a framework for integrating Kafka with external systems, enabling large-scale data import and export without custom code.


### 2. Key Features
- **Scalability:** Distributes work across multiple workers.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Automatically recovers from failures.
- **Extensibility:** Supports custom connectors.
- **Schema Management:** Integrates with Schema Registry for schema evolution.


### 3. Connector Types
- **Source Connectors:** Pull data from external systems into Kafka (e.g., JDBC Source, File Source).
- **Sink Connectors:** Push data from Kafka into external systems (e.g., Elasticsearch Sink, S3 Sink).


### 4. Example: Deploy a File Source Connector
```json
{
  "name": "local-file-source",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "FileStreamSource",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "file": "/tmp/test.txt",
    "topic": "file-topic"
  }
}
```
