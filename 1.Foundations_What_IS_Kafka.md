## #1 –  Apache Kafka

### 1. What is Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a **distributed event streaming platform** that acts as:
- A **messaging system** – delivering data between systems.
- A **log storage system** – retaining messages for a set time or forever.
- A **real-time processing backbone** – enabling immediate reaction to events.

It’s designed for **high throughput** (millions of events per second) and **low latency**.


### 2. Problems Kafka Solves
- Moving data between services **reliably and fast**.
- Decoupling producers and consumers.
- Buffering spikes in traffic.
- Storing events for replay or audit purposes.


### 3. Kafka vs. Other Messaging Systems

| Feature | Kafka | RabbitMQ | ActiveMQ | Pulsar |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Throughput | Very high (millions/sec) | Medium | Medium | High |
| Message Retention | Configurable, can keep forever | Short-term | Short-term | Long-term via BookKeeper |
| Ordering | Per partition | Per queue | Per queue | Per partition |
| Storage | Distributed log | In-memory/disk queue | In-memory/disk queue | Distributed log |
| Scaling | Horizontal via partitions | Limited by queue | Limited by queue | Horizontal via partitions |
| Primary Use | Event streaming, analytics | Task queues, RPC | Task queues | Event streaming, multi-tenancy |


### 4. Real-World Use Cases
- **Fraud detection** in banking.
- **IoT data ingestion** (sensor data).
- **E-commerce order tracking**.
- **Log aggregation**.
- **Streaming analytics**.


### 5. Core Concepts
- **Producer** → sends messages.
- **Consumer** → reads messages.
- **Topic** → named stream of messages.
- **Partition** → a split of a topic for parallelism.
- **Broker** → Kafka server storing partitions.
- **Offset** → position of a message in a partition.



### 6. Why Kafka for Real-Time Systems
- **Low latency** – milliseconds between produce and consume.
- **High throughput** – handles huge data streams.
- **Fault tolerance** – replication ensures durability.
- **Replay capability** – re-read events anytime.



### 7. Pros and Cons
**Pros**
- High performance and scalability.
- Persistent and replayable messages.
- Rich ecosystem (Kafka Streams, Connect, Schema Registry).

**Cons**
- Complex operations and monitoring.
- Steeper learning curve than simple queues.
- More infrastructure overhead.
