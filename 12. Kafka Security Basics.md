## Kafka Security Basics

### 1. Why Secure Kafka?
Kafka clusters often handle sensitive data and must be protected from unauthorized access and tampering.


### 2. Key Security Features

| Feature                 | Description                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Authentication**       | Verify the identity of clients (producers, consumers, brokers) |
| **Authorization**        | Control what authenticated clients are allowed to do (ACLs)   |
| **Encryption (TLS)**     | Encrypt data in transit between clients and brokers            |


### 3. Authentication Methods
- **SSL/TLS client certificates**
- **SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)** mechanisms:
  - SASL/PLAIN (username/password)
  - SASL/SCRAM (salted challenge-response)
  - SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos)


### 4. Enabling SSL Encryption
- Kafka brokers and clients must be configured with SSL certificates.
- Encrypts network traffic to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

### 5. Authorization with ACLs
- Kafka supports Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict actions like:
  - Producing to topics
  - Consuming from topics
  - Creating/deleting topics
- ACLs are managed via CLI or Admin API.


### 6. Example: Enable SSL on Broker (snippet from `server.properties`)
```properties
listeners=SSL://:9093
ssl.keystore.location=/var/private/ssl/kafka.server.keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=your-keystore-password
ssl.key.password=your-key-password
ssl.truststore.location=/var/private/ssl/kafka.server.truststore.jks
ssl.truststore.password=your-truststore-password
