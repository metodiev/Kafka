##  Kafka Fault Tolerance and Replication

### 1. What is Fault Tolerance in Kafka?
Fault tolerance ensures Kafka continues operating correctly even if some brokers fail, without data loss or downtime.


### 2. Replication Basics
- Each partition is replicated across multiple brokers.
- One broker acts as the **leader**, others as **followers**.
- Followers replicate the leader’s data asynchronously.


### 3. Leader and Followers
- The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition.
- Followers replicate the leader’s data to stay consistent.
- If the leader fails, a follower is elected as the new leader to maintain availability.


### 4. In-Sync Replicas (ISR)
- ISR is the set of replicas that are fully caught up with the leader.
- Only replicas in the ISR can be elected leader.
- Ensures only up-to-date replicas serve data.


### 5. Configurations Impacting Fault Tolerance
| Config                    | Description                                   | Example/Default       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `replication.factor`      | Number of copies of each partition             | `3` (recommended)     |
| `min.insync.replicas`     | Minimum ISR required for successful writes    | `2`                   |
| `acks` (producer side)    | Level of write acknowledgment from replicas   | `all` (for durability) |


### 6. Producer Acknowledgment and Durability
- With `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas` configured, producers get confirmation only when data is replicated to enough replicas.
- This ensures durability and prevents data loss on broker failures.


### 7. Summary
Kafka achieves fault tolerance by replicating partitions and carefully managing leaders and ISR sets.  
Proper replication and acknowledgment configurations are essential for reliable data delivery and availability.
