## Kafka Performance Tuning and Best Practices

### 1. Key Areas to Tune for Performance
- Broker configuration
- Producer and consumer settings
- Topic design and partitioning
- Hardware and network resources


### 2. Broker Tuning Tips
- Increase `num.network.threads` and `num.io.threads` based on CPU cores.
- Configure appropriate `log.segment.bytes` and `log.retention.ms`.
- Use SSDs for lower latency.
- Monitor and optimize garbage collection.


### 3. Topic and Partition Design
- Increase partitions to improve parallelism.
- Avoid too many small partitions (causes overhead).
- Balance partitions evenly across brokers.


### 4. Producer and Consumer Optimization
- Use batching (`linger.ms`, `batch.size`) to improve throughput.
- Enable compression (`snappy`, `lz4`, `zstd`).
- Tune consumer poll sizes (`max.poll.records`) and session timeouts.


### 5. Network and Hardware Considerations
- Use fast and reliable network connections.
- Ensure adequate RAM and CPU for brokers and clients.
- Separate Kafka logs on dedicated disks.


### 6. Best Practices
- Monitor cluster health continuously.
- Use replication factor of at least 3 for fault tolerance.
- Regularly review and tune configurations based on workload.
- Keep Kafka and clients updated to latest stable versions.
