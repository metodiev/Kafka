## Kafka Streams Overview

### 1. What is Kafka Streams?
Kafka Streams is a client library for building real-time, event-driven applications and microservices, processing data directly within Kafka.


### 2. Key Features
- **Stream Processing:** Process data as it arrives.
- **Stateful Operations:** Support for joins, aggregations, and windowing.
- **Fault Tolerant:** State is backed up in Kafka topics for recovery.
- **No Separate Cluster:** Runs inside your application.


### 3. Core Concepts
- **Stream:** Unbounded sequence of records.
- **Table:** Key-value pairs representing the latest state.
- **Topology:** Defines the flow of data processing steps.
- **State Store:** Local storage for maintaining state during processing.


### 4. Example: Word Count with Kafka Streams (Java)
```java
StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
KStream<String, String> textLines = builder.stream("TextTopic");
KTable<String, Long> wordCounts = textLines
    .flatMapValues(value -> Arrays.asList(value.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")))
    .groupBy((key, word) -> word)
    .count();
wordCounts.toStream().to("WordCountsTopic", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.Long()));
```

### 5. Use Cases
Real-time analytics dashboards.
Fraud detection pipelines.
Sensor data processing.
Enrichment and transformation of event streams.
